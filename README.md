# Ultrasound_Elastography
It is the  code from the Hassan Rivaz's paper .Below is the description from his website : http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~hrivaz/

Ultradound Elastography (C and Matlab MEX) Code and RF data

The code runs with more recent versions of Matlab in PC, Mac OS X and Linux platforms as well. Please let me know if 
you have problems running it.

The algorithm is based on the following two papers. If you use the code or the RF data (which contains data from some patient trials of liver ablation), please cite these papers.
